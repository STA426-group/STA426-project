### Data
- negative control data - two groups, each of three samples, from normal human dendritic cells ([data in GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64177))
- simulated data - simulated DMRs added to negative control by `simDMRS` function from `dmrseq` package ([docs](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/dmrseq/inst/doc/dmrseq.html#6_simulating_dmrs))
